CODE SCRIPT:

BASICS:

variables
  change color, updates everywhere
nesting
  oh wait, what's this ampersand thing?
ampersand
  two examples
  point out variables (have some color manipulation going on, we'll get to that)
extend
  easier to manage style blocks, better CSS output
mixins
  CSS3 mixins, font-face
  keep your vendor prefixes and IE hacks out of your application styles and in your mixins
  As standards change, just change your mixin
colors
  tons of color functions
  change default, changes all other colors
  imagine theming
calculations
  simple math, calculate width from two variables.
  Hall of wWAR bar: pass in start year, end year, and total value. Calculate width and margin from those.
  position based on value passed in (if/then statement)

ADVANCED:

compass
  grid example
responsive
  new features make RWD much easier
loops
  nested loops to create a large number of styles for seizure meter stream events
  7 different severity ratings
  10 different sizes based on quantity
sprites
  throw some images in a folder
  compiles the sprite, generates css for height/width/position
